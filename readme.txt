"Split Backorders plugin automatically creates a separate order with status “Backorders” for the products that are not in stock(products on backorder)"

Split Backorders plugin automatically creates a separate order with status “Backorders” for the products that are not in stock(products on backorder). It helps the admin to track the list of backorders received from the website and then the admin can focus which products can be delivered on time and which items he needs to arrange or should get back in stock in order to fulfill customer demand or order placed for the same. This Plugin helps to increase sales by providing customers with the ability to order products that are out of stock (backorders).


The various functionality provided at the admin end helps the admin to get the order information in a very clear way. There are different conditions according to which the admin can make the split of orders at the backend as per required the required way. Like if the admin wants to club all backorders( products out of stock) in one order and does not want in-stock order to split at all then this can be achieved by saving the Plugin setting accordingly.

One of the main settings which are required to make in the products being added store is in the Inventory > Backorders either be “Allow quantity below 0” or “Allow quantity below 0 and Notify Customer”. The first option enables the customer to place an order which is out of stock and the second option allows the customer to place an order for an out of stock product and gets notified for the same.
